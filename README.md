# MorphoAid 🧬

## Hi, we are the MorphoAid Software Engineering Team 👋

## About MorphoAid

*MorphoAid* is an AI-assisted medical platform designed to support hematological analysis from blood smear images.  
The platform focuses on improving the *efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility* of morphological cell analysis for clinicians and researchers.

MorphoAid integrates modern web technologies with machine learning to assist in:
- Blood smear image analysis
- Morphological feature extraction
- Clinical decision support
- Research-oriented data preparation workflows

This project is developed as a *Senior Project* under the Software Engineering program.
